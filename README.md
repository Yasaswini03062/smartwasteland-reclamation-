## Overview

The Smart Wasteland Reclamation System is a data-driven AI/ML solution designed to transform barren or unused land into fertile and productive areas. By analyzing soil data, environmental factors, and predictive 
models, the system helps identify the most suitable crops and reclamation strategies for a given wasteland.

## Objectives

Reclaim wastelands using data science and AI.

Recommend optimal crops for specific soil and climate conditions.

Provide a decision-support tool for sustainable agriculture.

Contribute to environmental restoration and food security.

## Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries/Frameworks: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub


Data: Soil and environmental datasets


##Features
 
 
 Soil fertility and feature importance analysis
 
 Machine learning models for crop recommendation
 
 Model comparison & evaluation (LightGBM, RandomForest, etc.)
 
 Visualization of important parameters

 Reproducible pipeline with requirements.txt
